## Introduction
Social Identity Theory states that the concept of ‘self’ derives in part from one’s perceived affiliations with and valuations of their social groups (Tajfel & Turner, 1979). When subscribing to social groups, members associate the group’s reputation with their own, and behaviors of the group are perceived to reflect upon its individual members. Additionally, group members tend to conceive of their group more positively than outsiders do, and they selectively emphasize features of the group’s identity to benefit their own self-conception (Tajfel, 1982). In order to preserve a positive social identity, group members have been shown to engage in a number of biased cognitive evasions. This self-serving motivation results in fundamentally skewed perceptions and evaluations of controversial evidence (Kunda, 1987).

In the past decade, morality has been shown to be an important dimension along which judgments of groups are made. Appraisals of a group’s morality influence individuals’ desires to affiliate with or distance themselves from that group even more so than the group’s task competence or sociability (Leach et al 2007). According to Social Identity Theory, the poor moral behavior of one’s social group would threaten the positive self-conception of the group’s members, ultimately causing a skewed perception of the poor behavior to rectify those individuals’ self-conception.

Indeed, mechanisms of biased moralistic appraisals of group performance have been demonstrated in cases of militaristic atrocity (e.g. torturing prisoners of war, or executing civilians for breaking curfew). Across several studies, participants of the same nationality as the perpetrator made biased, self-serving interpretations of the events, motives, and consequences (Leidner et al 2010; Leidner & Castano 2012; Roccas et al 2006). In Tarrant et al 2011, British participants read a newspaper clipping about prisoner of war torture committed by either British or American security. As expected, participants who read about British-committed torture were significantly more likely to rate it as serving greater justice than those reading the same story featuring an American transgressor.

When word of violent war crimes enters popular press, it has the potential to undermine not only the moral stature of culpable government officials, but also that of the nation's citizens. To minimize this threat, participants attenuate the severity of the moral transgression by interpreting it as serving values greater than immediate harm. However, these ‘greater values’ are inconsistent. They vary greatly depending on the goals of the perceiver. To characterize this evaluative shift, researchers employ Moral Foundations Theory, which identifies five moral considerations that underpin the majority of moral appraisals (Haidt & Graham, 2007; Haidt & Joseph, 2006). These foundations include Harm, Fairness, Loyalty, Authority, and Purity.

Applying Moral Foundations Theory has suggested a self-serving shift in moral values when appraising violent in-group transgressions. In Leidner and Castano (2012), American participants read a report on four cases of violent abuse against Iraqi prisoners of war, committed either by American or Australian soldiers. Participants wrote their own summary of the report, and the words they chose were assessed with a dictionary containing synonyms for each of the moral foundations (Purity excluded). In conditions of in-group perpetrated violence, participants more often used words associated with Loyalty and Authority than Harm and Fairness, but the opposite shift was observed when the torture featured an out-group perpetrator. Experiment 2 replicated these findings with an implicit lexical decisions task. Participants that read about in-group perpetrated violence more quickly distinguished Harm and Fairness words from non-words, while those in the out-group perpetrator condition more quickly identified words associated with Authority and Loyalty.

These findings suggest that participants engaged in a self-protective moral shift. When their social identity was threatened by in-group committed atrocity, they placed greater value on obedience and loyalty, but when the abuse occurred independent of participants’ national affiliation, the motive to attenuate the transgression disappeared.

Experiment 3 of Leidner and Castano (2012) and similar studies have also identified group glorification as a component of group affiliation that mediates the morality shifting effect. Whereas group attachment involves a sense of belongingness to the in-group, glorification involves a comparative belief that one’s group is superior to similar groups. While the effect of attachment has been inconsistent in literature, the effect of glorification has consistently been to exacerbate in-group bias (Leidner et al 2010; Leidner & Castano 2012; Roccas et al 2006).

## This Study
Our study seeks to examine moralistic group appraisals in contexts beyond direct harm violations or compliance to an authority’s direct orders (e.g. street harassment, flagrant sports fouls, or animal neglect). Participants will read about the actions of six perpetrators and appraise them along the five moral foundations. Three stories will be assigned at random to feature an in-group transgressor (UW-Madison student), while the other three will feature an out-group member (a student from a university in a neighboring state). Finally, participants will complete a survey regarding their glorification of UW-Madison as a social group.

Scenario 1 was designed to replicate the prisoner of war torture stories found in literature, since successfully reproducing their results would validate our methodology. In this scenario, student graduates from a university ROTC program followed through with orders to humiliate and torture middle-eastern prisoners of war.

We predict a main effect of perpetrator affiliation for Scenario 1. When appraising in-group transgressors, a moral shift towards loyalty and authority considerations would afford participants an unconscious strategy to reduce threat by placing focus on the transgressor's obedience and loyalty to his immediate group (i.e. other US soldiers).

However, it is unclear whether harm and fairness ratings will be lower in the in-group condition relative to the out-group condition. It is theoretically feasible that the rating will be lower, demonstrating participants' attempts to minimize the severity of the violence. Conversely, harm and fairness ratings may not differ across conditions, demonstrating that participants recognize the severity of the violation but attenuate its threat to their social identity by making stronger appeals to loyalty and authority. This ambiguity in predictive ability applies to each of the three scenarios.

We also predict a two-way interaction between perpetrator affiliation and UW glorification. High glorifiers of UW-Madison will engage in a stronger moral shift, rating loyalty and authority as significantly more important than they are by low glorifiers, but only when appraising in-group perpetrators. High glorifiers may even show the opposite moral shift when appraising out-group perpetrators, rating harm and fairness more highly than low glorifiers appraising the same out-group perpetrator.

Scenario 2 involves a student visiting a distant city in the United States where he instigates a bar fight. In this story, the perpetrator acts on his own volition, with no information provided about motive. Appeals to loyalty and authority do not provide participants a positive lens to view the story through. In fact, the perpetrator's actions may be interpreted as disloyal to the in-group, further contributing to the threat the in-group perpetrator poses to the participant’s social identity. The only exonerating strategy is to belittle the violence committed.

The main effect of perpetrator affiliation and the interaction between perpetrator affiliation and UW glorification are difficult to predict. Lower loyalty and authority importance ratings could demonstrate moral disengagement by the reasoning that the transgressor's actions were entirely independent of anything to do with UW-Madison. This strategy seems more likely for high glorifiers, since it protects the image of UW-Madison from the perpetrator’s actions.

On the other hand, participants may also distance themselves from the perpetrator by rating loyalty and authority as more highly important, rebuking the in-group transgressor for betraying the group’s ethical code while also acknowledging that UW-Madison as a group may contain other members that could commit such transgressions. This strategy seems more likely for low glorifiers, since it takes a critical perspective of UW-Madison as a group.

Finally, Scenario 3 features an undergraduate lab assistant who complies with instructions to falsify a report in order to cover up the preventable deaths of a few lab animals. Of the three scenarios presented, the context of this scenario seems most relatable for the participants involved, all of whom were recruited from an introductory psychology course. It features an undergraduate research assistant, working in an animal behavior lab, and takes place on UW campus (in-group condition). It also lacks alcohol and direct violence, which in other stories may allow participants to more easily distance themselves from the perpetrators.

We predict a main effect of perpetrator affiliation. In-group perpetrators will receive higher ratings of loyalty and authority consideration than out-group perpetrators, since the UW student’s transgression may be attenuated by considering his group-preserving compliance with the orders of his superior.

We also predict a two-way interaction between perpetrator affiliation and UW glorification. High glorifiers will be especially skewed towards higher loyalty and authority ratings when appraising the in-group student versus the out-group student. Low glorifiers will show the opposite trend, rating loyalty and authority lower when appraising the in-group student versus the out-group student. However, the difference will not be as large as it is for high glorifiers.
