Thank you for your participation. You are about to read six articles, each followed by questions that ask you to make judgments about the actions of one or more of the people involved.

We are interested in what you think about the morality of their actions. Morality refers to the rightness, or goodness of a behavior. An action that is not moral is considered "immoral." Please read each story, then answer the questions based on what you personally think. There are no right or wrong answers.

MADISON - Three American soldiers, all ROTC graduates from the University of Wisconsin, have been found responsible for viciously beating and harassing Iraqi prisoners of war, some of whom were already injured, a US military spokesman said last night.

Master Sergeant Linus Mahan, 35, was the most senior person in charge during the incident at Camp Bucca in southern Iraq. He knocked a prisoner to the ground and repeatedly kicked him in the groin, abdomen and head, encouraging subordinate soldiers to do the same. At least one prisoner suffered fatal injuries. Several others remain in critical condition.
