Thank you for your participation. You are about to read six articles, each followed by questions that ask you to make judgments about the actions of one or more of the people involved.

We are interested in what you think about the morality of their actions. Morality refers to the rightness, or goodness of a behavior. An action that is not moral is considered "immoral." Please read each story, then answer the questions based on what you personally think. There are no right or wrong answers.
 
If you have any questions, please ask your experimenter now. Otherwise, enter your participant number below, and click "next" to begin the first article.
