## Story 1: Prisoners of War
MADISON - Three **[American/Australian]** soldiers, all ROTC graduates from **[the University of Wisconsin/Royal Military College of Australia]**, have been found responsible for viciously beating and harassing Iraqi prisoners of war, some of whom were already injured, a **[US/Australian]** military spokesman said last night.

Master Sergeant Linus Mahan, 35, was the most senior person in charge during the incident at Camp Bucca in southern Iraq.

Several others remain in critical condition.

## Story 2: Halloween Battery (Stories 2:6 randomized)
MADISON - Halloween turned ugly for one young man early Saturday morning when he was beaten by two **[UW-Madison/Ohio State]** students who left their car after being yelled at for nearly hitting a pedestrian, Madison police reported.

The 20-year-old victim **[and the students from Ohio]** was visiting Madison for the annual Freakfest celebration. He suffered a broken cheekbone and a broken nose and was knocked unconscious in the attack around 2 a.m. in the 200 block of Langdon Street.

Police said the victim and others were on Langdon Street early Saturday morning when a car speeding by almost hit a pedestrian crossing the street.

"Several of the Halloween celebrators yelled at the driver," said police spokesman Jonathan McDole in the release. "The driver stopped, backed up and pulled into a driveway."

The driver and one passenger then got out and attacked a bystander, who told police he remembered being hit once in the head before falling unconscious.

The two attackers then got back into their silver-colored Nissan four-door car and drove away.

## Story 3: Spring Break Stabbing
PANAMA CITY BEACH - Police are on the lookout for a man from **[Wisconsin/Michigan]** for stabbing a Panama City native during a bar fight late Friday night.

The assailant, who appeared to be about 20 years old, was wearing a **[UW-Madison/University of Michigan]** sweatshirt - likely visiting Panama City Beach during the university’s spring break.

According to police spokesman, Sam Louis, the fight began when the assailant punched the victim, Randy Harrison, several times in the head inside the bar before a bystander tried to break up the fight. Police say the **[Wisconsin/Michigan]** student then stabbed the Panama City Beach native in the thigh with his pocketknife.

The victim was taken to Samaritan Medical Center with a non-life threatening injury.

## Story 4: Campus Tour Lie
During a University of **[Wisconsin/Illinois]** tour for college-bound high school students, the guide - a **[Wisconsin/Illinois]** student himself - was chatting with a prospective student. The high school senior mentioned that he heard the University of **[Wisconsin/Illinois]** had the highest rate of post-graduation employment in the Big 10. The tour guide knew this claim was false, but did not correct the prospective student. Instead, the guide confirmed that not only do **[Wisconsin/Illinois]** graduates find more jobs, but he added that those jobs were also better paying. The high schooler previously had his heart set on attending the University of Michigan, but changed his preference to the University of **[Wisconsin/Illinois]** following this conversation.

# Story 5: Basketball Flagrant Foul
A tense basketball game between **[the University of Wisconsin/Indiana University]** and Michigan State was nearing its final moments. The **[Wisconsin Badgers/Indiana Hoosiers]** were losing by 13 when the coach called “timeout” with forty seconds remaining. He was furious. Losing this game would also lose them their spot as a Top 25 ranked team. It was almost impossible to win at this point, but he instructed his point guard to intentionally foul the opposing team as soon as possible. This would stop the clock and give the Indiana Hoosiers another chance to gain possession.

The ball was successfully inbounded by Michigan State. Immediately, the **[Badgers/Hoosiers]** point guard slammed his fist onto the player’s wrist, causing him to drop the ball to hold his arm in pain. A foul was called, but the damage had already been done. The Michigan State player suffered a fractured wrist, and he would be out for the next 5 weeks due to the injury.

## Story 6: Rhesus Neglect
A **[University of Wisconsin/Ohio State]** undergraduate was working as a research assistant in an animal lab on campus. On Monday morning, he showed up to work to find that 3 rhesus monkeys had died over the weekend, apparently due to neglect. Everyone in the lab was very upset, especially the lab supervisor who was supposed to make sure this would never happen. As required when a research animal dies, somebody would have to submit an incident report to the **[University of Wisconsin/Ohio State]** Animal Research Board. If they told the truth, the lab would probably lose funding due to their negligence.

The supervisor decided to ask the undergraduate assistant to write a fraudulent report. He instructed the student to claim that the animals had been fed and cared for like normal, even though the student knew that was not true. The undergraduate student accepted the instructions and completed the false report as requested.
